TNT is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) operating a club based on the Minecraft DREAM server.

Creator: nftx.ton: Most players come from the traditional internet, and the token plan was drafted in a white paper in 2023. After long-term testing on the Ethereum testnet, the in-game player token plan will be replaced by TNT within the TON ecosystem. However, as one of the founders of both communities, I expect to introduce domestic players to the Web 3.0 community by 2025, with strict screening for those initially interested in participating. The token creation date is March 21, 2024, with a total issuance of 368,440,830,249.39 TNT, and there will be no further issuance after the initial distribution. 90% is prepared to be added to the pool. As the project team, I have not made any purchases, sales, or profits. Due to the hype, additional investment was made. Some early investors made tens of times their initial investments without any insider information. I would like to clarify that adding liquidity to the pool was unintentional. For unknown individuals, I consider them lucky. As for large holders selling, I feel comfortable. Unfortunately, although we prepared the white paper and groundwork last year, the handling of adding liquidity this time was not ideal. These are not issues for us. The reason for creating the first market-cap pool was to allow people to create billion-dollar stories through marketization. Early profit-makers, even after selling their shares, can join as members. This is a long-term project. I believe the DAO organization resembles the concept of anonymity. After listing, there is a two-year lock-in period, during which we have conducted three rounds of token burns based on the total market cap at the time, destroying 4% of the total market cap three times. I forgot the exact amount, but it was likely not less than $5,000. TNT tokens are primarily empowered and applied through the following means:

- Players can use in-game resources to exchange for TNT within the server.
- TNT holders will gain voting rights (equity).
- Since mid-2023, long-term testing on the SepoliaETH testnet has been carried out to ensure players have no transaction costs.
- Players on the server are gradually transitioning from Web 2 to Web 3, but this process won’t be too fast, providing us with good development space.
- Promoting DAO autonomy and enhancing the mutual reinforcement between the Web 3 community and the Web 2 server community.
- One year later, rewards will be distributed to players who contributed to the Minecraft server.
- Adding meme community attributes and developing related ecosystems.

Regarding the previous incident, I had to take certain measures due to various considerations. The content on Twitter will remain unchanged, but the information on the Telegram channel will be updated. Currently, I have provided most people with compensation either in US dollars or new equity tokens. I have taken these actions to promptly correct the mistakes we encountered and ensure more stable and long-term future development. If anyone was missed in the compensation process, please contact me via private message, and I will respond to everyone. I know that some people may be disappointed in me or even speak ill of me, but I am more concerned with resolving the issues promptly and prioritizing the community's long-term interests.

As a nascent meme and DAO community, we started from scratch, and it's inevitable that we would encounter various issues and doubts. As far as I know, no one I personally know was involved in any of the transactions. For those who made tens of times their initial investment, I’m not even sure if I’ve ever spoken to them. Their selling actions did affect the price and exposed many issues. Throughout the process, I did not make any profit and have continuously reinvested. To this day, we still haven't fully utilized the previous advertising budget. I apologize for the problems caused and for my shortcomings. Now, we are starting from a new point and will move forward more cautiously.

The previous liquidity pool was locked, but as the initiator, I could extract value from it when it matured. In the new token system, we plan to destroy all liquidity pools—this is all to ensure a more stable and sustainable future.

Our project has not shifted direction; we are simply addressing issues and hidden risks early on to ensure stable future development. We are currently correcting past mistakes and, once this crisis stabilizes, will steadily move forward, focusing on more efficient work. We need a lot of talented individuals to join us, and for that, we deeply apologize and hope you will give us some time. Rest assured that all issues will be resolved, and signs of recovery are already visible. As a community member, your opinions are crucial to us.

I have publicly stated my position regarding the shares I hold, and I am confident in resolving misunderstandings and traditional biases. I remain sincere, although some people may suffer losses due to the short-sighted actions of early investors and direct their anger at me. I once believed that attracting more members through low market cap and high surges was feasible, but I soon realized it was a mistake. I am grateful for this realization and have adjusted my approach based on the enthusiasm of the community. I will not rush to take action or rush to destroy liquidity. I hope not to let everyone down and will take full responsibility for everything.

As for the potential of the project, this is a long-term investment. If you are a short-term investor, please consider carefully. We have a clear understanding of the current status of the project. If you are willing to join our team, you don't even need to invest—just let us know your capabilities. We need strong investment, not compromise with speculators. I now understand that they may never fully trust the project team, but we have already identified the key issues.

Thank you to those who continue to support me. Now, I am no longer alone—it is all of us, as part of a team, a community, and an organization. As long as someone holds tokens, they represent this DAO. Next, I will thoroughly check and test the contract within 12 hours to ensure there are no issues in the future and no scalability problems. After that, I will begin to destroy liquidity, relinquish management authority, and organize our history. I am tired of compromising with speculators, and I will devote myself to truly productive work.

As for community members, I generally do not intervene, as our community has game-like, meme, and equity DAO organizational characteristics.

To new friends exploring our game or project, I would like to introduce some servers worth checking out. For example, Hypixel is one of the most famous Minecraft servers, known for its scale and variety; Mineplex is also a popular large server; EnderCraft focuses on survival mode; and 2b2t offers an anarchy-style gaming environment. These servers all represent traditional web2 models, but our goal is to create a web2.5 game ecosystem based on blockchain. Minecraft server games themselves are infinitely scalable and creative, but they are often centralized, meaning that as service providers, we can make changes at will. However, with the introduction of blockchain technology, every aspect of the game becomes transparent and valuable, with each element being unique, achieving true ownership—this is the essence of web3. If we fully pursue transferring game content to the blockchain, it might sacrifice the game's scalability and creativity. Therefore, our strategy is to mint and mine only a few very precious and rare in-game items through blockchain technology. Based on this transparent data, we can apply it to the server's functions and entertainment activities. Our starting point is the token system, which is crucial for open-world game players as it provides meaningful value exchange and reward systems. In this way, we retain the core features of the game while giving players new ownership and value experiences.

Our project has had a clear whitepaper and development plan since 2023. Although I personally feel a bit overwhelmed at the moment, I still firmly believe in a step-by-step development strategy. Our team members are key to our success, and it will take time to select high-quality team members. Our goals are ambitious, and we plan to get listed on exchanges as soon as possible and use web3 funds to create a mutually beneficial positive cycle on traditional servers. I am no longer content with just talking about ideals. I will hand over the enthusiasm and market drive to the team members, and I will focus on other productive work. The community members will also have clearly defined roles and will work together to build. We will start from zero and move toward infinite possibilities, soaring to the stars together.
